# Getting started
In this tutorial, we are going to develop a simple anomaly detection service that identifies irregularities in time-series data. Specifically, we will focus on detecting anomalies in a continuous signal, in particilar we are going to detect anomalies in voltage measurements.

To begin, we need to create a time-series dataset that simulates the behavior of a 50Hz AC power signal (230V). The dataset will consist of a continuous sinusoidal wave, representing the normal operation of the system, and occasional anomalies injected randomly to simulate sudden voltage drops.

Weâ€™ll start by writing a Python script to generate this synthetic dataset. The script will create a normal sinusoidal wave and inject anomalies based on a given probability and duration. 

Below is the explanation of the key parameters:

* **duration**: The total time in seconds for the dataset.
* **sampling_rate**: The number of samples collected per second.
* **frequency**: The frequency of the sinusoidal wave, which for a standard power signal is typically 50 Hz.
* **amplitude**: The peak amplitude of the signal in volts, which corresponds to the RMS value of the power supply (e.g., 230V).
* **anomaly_probability**: The probability of injecting an anomaly at any given point. A lower probability will result in fewer anomalies.
* **anomaly_duration**: The duration of the anomaly, in terms of the number of samples. This controls how long each anomaly lasts.
* **anomaly_drop**: The percentage drop in voltage during the anomaly (e.g., a value of 0.2 will simulate an 80% voltage drop).

The resulting dataset will contain three main columns:

* **time**: The time index for each sample.
* **normal_wave**: The sinusoidal wave timeseries representing normal operation.
* **anomaly_wave**: The wave timeseries with injected anomalies.
* **is_anomaly**: A label indicating if the sample contains an anomaly (1) or not (0).

Below is an example of the dataset:

| time  | normal_wave | abnormal_wave | is_anomaly |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 0.001 | 325         | 325           | 0          |
| 0.002 | 324         | 324           | 0          |
| 0.003 | 322         | 258           | 1          |
| 0.004 | 319         | 255           | 1          |
| 0.005 | 315         | 315           | 0          |

In this table, the abnormal wave column shows the effect of an anomaly at time 0.003s and 0.004s, where the voltage dropped significantly. The corresponding entries in the anomaly label column are set to 1 to indicate the presence of an anomaly. Below is a picture showing 2 anomalies where the power has dropped.

## Detecting anomalies
We are going to use a very simple method to detect anomalies based on **Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence**. KL divergence measures how one probability distribution differs from a reference distribution, thus making useful to detect anomalies in time-series data.

In our case, we will treat the normal signal as our reference distribution and the potentially anomalous signal as the second distribution. By comparing these two distributions, we can 
calculate how much the abnormal signal deviates from what we expect under normal conditions.

## KL Divergence Formula
The KL divergence between two probability distributions *P* (the reference distribution) and *Q* (the observed distribution) is calculated as follows:

Where:
- *P(i)* is the probability of the signal in the normal distribution at bin *i*,
- *Q(i)* is the probability of the signal in the abnormal distribution at bin  *i*,
- *log P(i)/Q(i)* measures the divergence between the two distributions for each bin.

KL divergence essentially tells us how much information is lost when one distribution (the normal signal) is used to approximate another distribution (the abnormal signal). A higher KL divergence value means that the abnormal signal is significantly different from the normal one, and this difference could be indicative of an anomaly.
